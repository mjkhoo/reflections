    A git repository is created. You need to initialize, as this is not created automatically when you create the directory. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area provides a useful place for you to organize your thoughts about the logical units of a project, before you actually make a commit to that project.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    You can review the changes you make in the changing area ... I am assuming that using the changing area to think about projects helps you to better understand the process you are making, until you reach a logical stopping point for that task.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

    Branches can be useful when you want to explore adding a new feature to a piece of code. This could be experimental. This is in contrast to other coding activities, such as debugging, and improvement/development of existing features, which maybe make smaller increments.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
