When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A: This is useful for collaborating with other individuals remotely, - and also maybe when you have access to different computers?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: You would want to pull changes manually because this gives you more control over when you update your local directory - perhaps after you have finished a particular piece of work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A: A fork is where a Github repository is cloned on the Github server, and the clone is made in the account of a new person. Once the project is forked, then the forker can use the clone without affecting the original project. I would fork a project if I needed to experiment with someone else's project, without them necessarily being involved.

A clone is a local copy of a project somewhere else. It could be cloned from Github, or from someone else's computer. I would clone a project if I was for example going to work on a project with someone, and would download from either my or their Github repository. 

A branch is a separate part of the code for a particular project. I might use a branch when I wanted to add a new feature to an existing project, and I could work on it without it affecting the rest of the code. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

You can get a current snapshot, and then work offline. 


For example, you could look for conflicts and merge local and Github files.

This saves you from having to be permanently online and, thinking about it, from having many micro-conflicts emerge as people work on a project. Again, it helps people to chunk a project into logical sub-units.
